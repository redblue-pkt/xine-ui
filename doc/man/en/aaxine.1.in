.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains the
.B aaxine
program. Aaxine, is an aalib based frontend for libxine, a versatile
video/multimedia player.
.PP
\fBaaxine\fP is for those who don't have a high end video card, but just
want to watch DVDs on their good old vt100 ;-)

Like xine, \fBaaxine\fP plays MPEG system (audio and video) streams, mpeg
elementary streams (e.g. .mp3 or .mpv files), avi files (using win32 codecs
or ffmpeg), (S)VCDs and DVDs. In short, anything that's supported by xine-lib.

.SH OPTIONS
The program follows usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options are included below.
For a complete description, see \fIREADME\fP and \fIFAQ\fP in \fI@XINE_DOCDIR@\fP
or on the xine home page.
.TP
.B \-h,\ \-\-help
Show summary of options and available output drivers (plugins).
.PP
A big bunch of these options is provided by aalib. Please refer to your
aalib documentation for those!
.PP
The remaining options, labelled
.B AAXINE options:
when listed with "\fIaaxine \-\-help\fP", are explained here.
.TP
.BI \-A,\ \-\-audio-driver\  <drv>
Use given audio driver. Available drivers can be listed with "aaxine \-\-help"
.TP
.BI \-a,\ \-\-audio-channel\  <num>
Use given audio channel. Channels are sequentially numbered from 0 for
first audio track. 
.TP
.BI \-R,\ \-\-recognize-by\  [option]
Determine the method used to recognize stream type. Possible options are:
.br
`\fBdefault\fP': by content, then by extension,
.br
`\fBrevert\fP': by extension, then by content,
.br
`\fBcontent\fP': only by content,
.br
`\fBextension\fP': only by extension.
.br
If \fB\-R\fP is given without an additional option, `\fBrevert\fP' is selected.

.SH MRLs
MRLs are similar to URLs in your web browser. They describe the media
to read from. valid MRLs may be plain file names or one of the following:
.br
.BI file: <path>
.br
.BI fifo: <path>
.br
.B stdin:/
.br
.BI dvd:/ <title> . <part>
.br
.BI vcd:/ <tracknumber>
.br
.BI tcp:// <host> : <port>
.br
.BI rtp:// <host> : <port>
.br
.BI udp:// <host> : <port>
.br
.BI mms:// <host>...
.br
.BI http:// <host>...
.LP
Several MRLs may be specified in order to play a number of consecutive
streams. Additional input plugins will provide additional MRL types.
The ones listed above are available with stock libxine...
