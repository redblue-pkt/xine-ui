.SH NAME
xine \- a free video player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xine
.I "[options] [MRL] ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR xine
audio/video player.
.PP
.B xine
plays MPEG system (audio and video) streams, mpeg elementary streams
(e.g. .mp3 or .mpv files), avi files (using win32 codecs), (S)VCDs
and DVDs.
.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options are included below.
For a complete description, see the README and FAQ in @prefix@/share/doc/xine
or on the xine home page.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and available output drivers (plugins).
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-audio\-channel <num>
Select the given audio channel. <num> is the audio channel number, default
is "0".
.br
xine 0.5 and newer tries it's best to collect all valid audio channels
(ac3, mpeg audio, avi audio, ...) from the stream and maps them
to "virtual channels" with channel numbers starting at 0.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-video\-driver <drv>
Select video driver. Check out "xine --help" for a list of available
video output plugins on your system. This selection is stored automatically
in your .xinerc so you'll have to specify the video driver only once.
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-audio\-driver <drv>
Select audio driver. Check out "xine --help" for a list of available
audio output plugins on your system. This selection is stored automatically
in your .xinerc so you'll have to specify the audio driver only once.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-spu\-channel <num>
Select subpicture (subtitle) channel. <num> is the subpicture channel
id, default is no subtitle (-1).
.TP
.B \-p[f][h][q][d][v]
Start playing immediately after start. Can be followed by "f" to turn
on fullscreen mode and/or "h" to hide GUI, and/or by "q" for quitting 
at the end. It is also possible to request the playlist from DVD 'd',
or VCD 'v'.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-recognize\-by <option>
Change the way xine will try to recognize stream types. 
Valid options are: "default" (first by content, then by extension),
"revert" (first by extension, then by content),
"content" (only by content),
"extension" (only by extension). Ff no option is given, 
"revert" is selected
.TP
.B MRL (media resource locator)
.br
MRLs are similar to URLs in your web browser. They describe the media
to read from. valid MRLs may be plain file names or one of the following:
.BR file://<path>
.br
.BR fifo://<path>
.br
.BR stdin://mpeg1
or
.BR "stdin://mpeg2"
.br
.BR dvd://VTS_xx_y.VOB
.br
.BR "vcd://<track number>"
.br
.BR "net://???"
.LP
Several MRLs may be specified in order to play a number of consecutive
streams.
.LP
If you don't specify any MRL, you'll have to select  a file by drag'n-drop.
Dragging files from the GNOME Midnight Commander (gmc) is known to work.

press if video lags behind audio
.br
.BR Home :
press to reset audio/video offset to 0, so stream timestamps are unchanged.
