.SH NAME
xine \- a free video player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xine
.I "[options] [MRL] ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR xine
audio/video player.
.PP
.B xine
plays MPEG system (audio and video) streams, mpeg elementary streams
(e.g. .mp3 or .mpv files), mpeg transport streams, ogg files,
avi files, asf files, quicktime files, (S)VCDs and DVDs.
.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`--').
A summary of options are included below.
For a complete description, see \fIREADME\fP and \fIFAQ\fP in \fI@XINE_DOCDIR@\fP
or on the xine home page.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and available output drivers (plugins).
.TP
.BI \-a,\ \-\-audio\-channel\  <num>
Select the given audio channel. \fI<num>\fP is the audio channel number, default
is \fB0\fP.
.br
xine 0.5 and newer tries its best to collect all valid audio channels
(ac3, mpeg audio, avi audio, ...) from the stream and maps them
to "virtual channels" with channel numbers starting at \fB0\fP.
.TP
.BI \-V,\ \-\-video\-driver\  <drv>
Select video driver. Check out \fIxine\ \-\-help\fP for a list of available
video output plugins on your system. This selection is stored automatically
in your \fI~/.xine/config\fP so you'll have to specify the video driver only once.
.TP
.BI \-A,\ \-\-audio\-driver\  <drv>
Select audio driver. Check out \fIxine \-\-help\fP for a list of available
audio output plugins on your system. This selection is stored automatically
in your \fI~/.xine/config\fP so you'll have to specify the audio driver only once.
.TP
.BI \-u,\ \-\-spu\-channel\  <num>
Select subpicture (subtitle) channel. \fI<num>\fP is the subpicture channel
id, default is no subtitle (\fB\-1\fP).
.TP
.BI \-p,\ \-\-auto\-play= [f][F][h][w][q][d][v]
Start playing immediately after start. Can be followed by:
.br
`\fIf\fP' in fullscreen mode,
.br
`\fIF\fP' in xinerama fullscreen mode,
.br
`\fIh\fP' hide GUI (main panel, etc...),
.br
`\fIw\fP' hide video output window,
.br
`\fIq\fP' for quitting after playback,
.br
It is also possible to request the playlist from DVD `\fId\fP', or VCD `\fIv\fP'. 
There is now a more generic option, \fI\-\-auto\-scan\fP, for that (see below).
.TP
.BI \-s,\ \-\-auto\-scan\  <plugin>
Auto-scan playlist from named input plugin. Many plugins allow to read a
default playlist, in order to play \fBeverything\fP. This works fine for DVDs
or VCDs, for example. Giving this option has the same effect as pressing
the according button on xine's main panel.

This option is especially useful in combination with auto-play. You could
start \fIxine\~\-\-auto\-play\~\-\-auto\-scan\~dvd\fP in order to play a whole DVD without
having to press any additional buttons. This also works for plugins that are
not supplied with xine, just give the name of the button that the desired
plugin adds to the xine panel!
.TP
.B \-f,\ \-\-fullscreen
Switch xine to fullscreen mode on start (just like pressing `\fBf\fP')
.TP
.B \-F,\ \-\-xineramafull
Switch xine to xinerama fullscreen mode on start (just like pressing `\fBF\fP').
That is to say, try to expand display on several screens. Screens to use are defined in config file.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-hide\-gui
Hide all GUI windows (except the video window) on start. This is the same as
pressing `\fBG\fP' within xine.
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-hide\-video
Hide video output window.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-no\-lirc
Turn off LIRC support. This option is \fIonly\~available\fP if xine has been compiled
with LIRC support.
.TP
.BI \-\-visual\  <visual\-class\-or\-id>
Try to use a specific X11 server visual for xine windows.  The
\fI<visual\-class\-or\-id>\fP parameter is either the name of an X11 visual
class (\fBStaticGray\fP, \fBGrayScale\fP, \fBStaticColor\fP, \fBPseudoColor\fP, \fBTrueColor\fP or
\fBDirectColor\fP) or the \fBhexadecimal\fP value for a specific X11 visual.

When used with a visual class name, xine tries to find such a visual
with depth \fB15\fP or \fB16\fP, \fB24\fP, \fB32\fP or \fB8\fP (in that order).
The default visual class used by xine in absence of a \fI\-\-visual\fP option is \fBTrueColor\fP.

If no usable visual is found, xine falls back to the default visual used 
on the X11 server's root window.
.TP
.B \-\-install
When using an X11 visual with changeable colors (colormaps), install a
private colormap for xine. With a private colormap, xine can allocate
more colors so that video output may look better.
.TP
.BI \-\-keymap\  [option]
Display keymap. Option are:
.br
`\fBdefault\fP' display default keymap table,
.br
`\fBlirc\fP' display draft of a \fI~/.lircrc\fP config file,
.br
`\fBremapped\fP' user remapped keymap table,
.br
If no option is given, `\fBdefault\fP' is selected.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-network
Enable network remote control server.
To use network remote control server, a password file is required. 
If xine cannot find it, the server is stopped. 
The syntax of the password file follows the (familliar) scheme
<\fIidentification\fP>:<\fIpassword\fP>. Since cryptography is subject to
legal issues in some countries, the password is not encrypted and also
transmitted unencrypted, so take care with remote connections.
Two (optional) generic rules are available as well (one at a time)
.nf
\fBALL:ALLOW\fP or \fBALL:DENY\fP
.fi
In the first case, all clients are allowed to execute all available commands, 
without restriction. In the second case, no\-one is allowed to execute 
any commands, except identified users (using 'identify' command).

If a password entry begins with an asterisk `\fB*\fP', 
the user is blocked. If a password entry is empty, 
the full entry is ignored. Here is an example
of a small \fI~/.xine/passwd\fP file:
.nf

ALL:DENY
daniel:mypasswd
foo:*

.fi
This will allow only 'daniel' to execute commands, 
after a successfully identifying stage.

The default port of the server is \fB6789\fP, this number is totally arbitrary. You can connect the server using a simple \fItelnet\fP command:
.nf
\fBtelnet\~localhost\~6789\fP
.fi
To change the default port, you can (as root) edit your \fI/etc/services\fP, and add an entry like this:
.nf

xinectl    7890/tcp        # xine control

.fi
This will change the default port from 6789 to 7890, and create a "human" service 
called \fIxinectl\fP.

The server itself offers command help/syntax:
.br
.BI help\  [command]
.br
Without \fIcommand\fP specified, all available commands will be displayed. 
If a command is specified, short text about the command functionnality will
be given.
.br
.BI syntax\  <command>
.br
Display the \fIcommand\fP syntax.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-root
Use root window as video window.
.TP
.BI \-G,\ \-\-geometry\  <WxH[+X+Y]>
You can set video output size and position using the X like geometry (see \fBX\fR(7)).
\fBX\fP and \fBY\fP offset are optional.
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-borderless
Remove borders of video output window, in windowed mode.
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-playlist <filename>
Use file as playlist. Known formats are: asx, toxine, m3u, pls, sfv and raw text file.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loop [mode]
Set playlist loop mode. If mode isn't specified, mode \fBloop\fP is used. Possible modes are:
.br
\fBloop\fP: loop entire playlist.
.br
\fBrepeat\fP: repeat current playlist entry.
.br
\fBshuffle\fP: select randomly an entry in playlist from those not yet played.
.br
\fBshuffle\+\fP: same as shuffle, but indefinetely replay the playlist.
.TP
.B \-\-skin\-server\-url <url>
Define the skin server url.
.TP
.B \-\-enqueue <mrl>
.br
Enqueue mrl of a running session (session 0). This option can be used more than one time.
.br
If you want to specify another session, use \fB\-S session=\fP\fIx\fP option. 
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-session <option1,option2,...>
.br
Session managements. All options can be used more than one time, except \fBsession\fP.
.br
Options are:
.br
\fBsession=\fP\fIn\fP specify session \<\fIn\fP\> number,
.br
\fBmrl=\fP\fIm\fP     add mrl \<\fIm\fP\> to the playlist,
.br
\fBaudio=\fP\fIc\fP   select audio channel (\<\fIc\fP\>: \fBnext\fP or \fBprev\fP),
.br
\fBspu=\fP\fIc\fP     select spu channel (\<\fIc\fP\>: \fBnext\fP or \fBprev\fP),
.br
(\fBplaylist\fP|\fBpl\fP)\fB=\fP\fIp\fP
.br
  \<\fIp\fP\> can be:
.br
    \fBclear\fP:     clear the playlist,
    \fBnext\fP:      play next playlist entry,
    \fBprev\fP:      play previous playlist entry,
    \fBload:\fP\fIs\fP:    load playlist file <\fIs\fP>.
.br
There are also some self explanatory options.
    \fBplay\fP, \fBslow2\fP, \fBslow4\fP, \fBpause\fP, \fBfast2\fP, \fBfast4\fP, \fBstop\fP, \fBquit\fP, \fBfullscreen\fP, \fBeject\fP.
.TP
.B MRL (media resource locator)
.br
MRLs are similar to URLs in your web browser. They describe the media
to read from. valid MRLs may be plain file names or one of the following:
.br
.BI file: <path>
.br
.BI fifo: <path>
.br
.B stdin:/
.br
.BI dvd:/ <title> . <part>
.br
.BI vcd:/ <tracknumber>
.br
.BI tcp:// <host> : <port>
.br
.BI rtp:// <host> : <port>
.br
.BI udp:// <host> : <port>
.br
.BI mms:// <host>...
.br
.BI http:// <host>...
.LP
Several MRLs may be specified in order to play a number of consecutive
streams. Additional input plugins will provide additional MRL types.
The ones listed above are available with stock libxine...
.LP
If you don't specify any MRL, you'll have to select a file by drag'n\-drop.
Dragging files from the \fBGNOME\~Midnight\~Commander\fP (gmc), \fBNautilus\fP or \fBKonqueror\fP
is known to work.
.TP
.B external subtitle files (any mrl)
.br
Text subtitle files may be appended to the MRL:
.br 
.BI <mrl>::<subtitlefile>
.br 
This is the xine-ui specific way to define the subtitle file to use. The filename will be
extracted by the frontend, that permit to change it, save it in a playlist, etc...
.br
.BI <mrl>#subtitle:<subtitlefile>
.br
This is the xine-lib specific way to define the subtitle file to use. The frontend will 
not take attention about the subtitle file.
.br Note: 
.TP
.B stream options
.br
After a delimiting
.B #
you can add several stream parameters:
.TP
.B novideo
video will be ignored
.TP
.B noaudio
audio will be ignored
.TP
.B nospu
subpictures will be ignored
.TP
.BI demux: <demux\ name>

.SS Third party plugins
Following shortcuts are used by third party plugins, generally for DVD navigation:
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Up>\fP"
Up event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Down>\fP"
Down event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Left>\fP"
Left event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Right>\fP"
Right event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Prior>\fP"
Prior event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Next>\fP"
Next event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ End>\fP"
Previous angle event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Home>\fP"
Next angle event.
.IP "\fB<KeyPad\ Enter>\fP"
Select event

.SS Synchronization fine tuning
Some streams have bad timestamps, so synchronization fails. This can be
tweaked using these keys:
.IP "n"
press if video runs ahead of audio
.IP "m"
press if video lags behind audio
.IP "\fB<home>\fP"
press to reset audio/video offset to \fB0\fP, so stream timestamps are unchanged.

.SS Subtitle synchronization
You can adjust subtitle synchronization by using these keys:
.IP "M / N"

.SS Numeric Input
It is possible to give numeric input, however for backward
compatibility the number keys are not bound their corresponding digit
values. Moreover, the digits 0 to 9 are bound to symbols that can't
normally be entered on a keyboard. Thus the ability to enter numeric
input is disabled by default. However you can change this by switching
the modifier value of "SetPosition\fI<X>\fR%" and "Number\fI<Y>\fR" (where
\fI<X>\fR is 0, 10, .. 90, and \fI<Y>\fR is 0..9). In particular replace
these lines in your xine keymap file \fI~/.xine/keymap\fP.

.Vb
# Set position to beginning or 10..90% of current stream.
SetPosition0% {
	key = 0
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition10% {
	key = 1
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition20% {
	key = 2
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition30% {
	key = 3
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition40% {
	key = 4
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition50% {
	key = 5
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition60% {
	key = 6
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition70% {
	key = 7
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition80% {
	key = 8
	modifier = mod3
}
SetPosition90% {
	key = 9
	modifier = mod3
}

# Enter the numbers 0..9.
Number0 {
	key = 0
	modifier = none
}
Number1 {
	key = 1
	modifier = none
}
Number2 {
	key = 2
	modifier = none
}
Number3 {
	key = 3
	modifier = none
}
Number4 {
	key = 4
	modifier = none
}
Number5 {
	key = 5
	modifier = none
}
Number6 {
	key = 6
	modifier = none
}
Number7 {
	key = 7
	modifier = none
}
Number8 {
	key = 8
	modifier = none
}
Number9 {
	key = 9
	modifier = none
}
.Ve
.PP
Having made the above change, you can specify a numeric argument to be
applied to a command typing in a number and then entering a function
key. For example entering "99/", that is, the number-9 key twice and then
the slash key, you should seek 99% of the current stream. 
.PP
The new experimental VCD/SVCD plugin, VCDX, allows some numeric
input. Entering a number followed by the "Select event" (by default
the keypad enter), one can go to a specific "Chapter" (track or entry)
or selection number. As this is a relatively new feature, perhaps over
time more plugins will make use of numeric selection.
.PP
Other commands that can be numeric prefaced by a numeric argument are
next/previous MRL (\fBMRL_NEXT\fP, \fBMRL_PRIOR\fP), next/previous subtitle
(\fBSPU_NEXT\fP, \fBSPU_PRIOR\fP), and next/previous audio channel
(\fBAUDIOCHAN_NEXT\fP, \fBAUDIOCHAN_PRIOR\fP). With a numeric prefix, it is as
though one entered that command the number of times.  Here, the
argument 0, since it would otherwise meaningless, is interpreted here
to be 1 instead. 
.PP 
Admittedly the use of numeric input here is of limited value. Over
time perhaps more useful commands like specifying a specific or
absolute MRL, subtitle or audio channel number will be implemented.
