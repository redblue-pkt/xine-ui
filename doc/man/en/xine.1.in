.SH NAME
xine \- MPEG2/MPEG1 audio/video player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xine
.I "[options] [MRL] ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR xine
audio/video player.
.PP
.B xine
plays MPEG system streams, synchronizing audio and video substreams. It
can play streams from files, Video CDs, DVDs and other sources.
.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options are included below.
For a complete description, see the README and FAQ in @prefix@/share/doc/xine
or on the xine home page.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-shared\-memory
Use X shared memory extension for output.
.br
This may be useful if you experience
problems using the Xv extension. Xv is used as default, if it is available.
Since Xv is hardware accelerated, it usually provides more features and
better performance.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-audio\-channel <num>
Select the given audio channel. <num> is the audio channel number, default
is "0".
.br
For MPEG2-Streams, AC3 audio streams are numbered from 0 to 7, while MPEG
audio streams are numbered from 8 to 15 and lpcm audio streams are
numbered 16 to 23 (provided that there are this many audio substreams, 
of course). Finding the right audio stream might needs some experimenting,
as some mp2-streams contain audio in strange tracks (track 0 and 1 may
be empty but track 2 contains valid audio, for example).
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-audio\-driver <drv>
Select audio driver. Valid drivers are "oss", "alsa", "esd" or "null". The
default is to use ESD when the "ESPEAKER" environment variable is set,
otherwise ALSA if present, otherwise OSS. The "null" driver may be used to
disable audio output, eg. if there are problems with your sound card.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-spu\-channel <num>
Select subpicture (subtitle) channel. <num> is the subpicture channel
id, default is no subtitle (-1).
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-spdif
Enable AC3 output via SPDIF. Works only on some ALSA drivers that support
the AC3 passthrough feature.
.TP
.B \-p[f][h][q][d][v]
Start playing immediately after start. Can be followed by "f" to turn
on fullscreen mode and/or "h" to hide GUI, and/or by "q" for quitting 
at the end. It is also possible to request the playlist from DVD 'd',
or VCD 'v'.
.TP
.B MRL (media resource locator)
.br
MRLs are similar to URLs in your web browser. They describe the media
to read from. valid MRLs may be plain file names or one of the following:
.BR file://<path>
.br
.BR fifo://<path>
.br
.BR stdin://mpeg1
or
.BR "stdin://mpeg2"
.br
.BR dvd://VTS_xx_y.VOB
.br
.BR "vcd://<track number>"
.br
.BR "net://???"
.LP
Several MRLs may be specified in order to play a number of consecutive
streams.
.LP
If you don't specify any MRL, you'll have to select  a file by drag'n-drop.
Dragging files from the GNOME Midnight Commander (gmc) is known to work.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The programs are documented fully on the xine home page:
.IR "http://xine.sourceforge.net/"
.SH CONTROL KEYS
Many features can be controlled by pressing control keys. The Key bindings are:
.LP
.BR RETURN :
Play
.br
.BR SPACE
or
.BR P :
Pause
.br
.BR F :
Toggle fullscreen mode (Xv only)
.br
.BR G :
Hide/show the gui.
.br
.BR H :
Hide/show the video output window.
.br
.BR A :
Toggle aspect ratio (AUTO/16:9/4:3/DVB) 
.br
.BR C :
Show/hide the video settings window.
.br
.BR E :
Eject the current media.
.br
.BR 0 :
Jump to start of current stream
.br
.BR 1..9 :
Jump to 10%..90% of current stream
.br
.BR PgUp :
Jump to previous stream in playlist
.br
.BR PgDown :
Jump to next stream in playlist
.br
.BR + :
Select next audio channel (may take up to a few seconds to take effect)
.br
.BR - :
Select prev audio channel
.br
.BR Ctrl
Show/hide mouse cursor (only when the GUI is hide)
.br
.BR >
or
.BR . :
Select next sub-title channel.
.br
.BR <
or
.BR , :
Select previous sub-title channel.
.br
.SH Synchronization fine tuning
Some streams have bad timestamps, so synchronization fails. This can be
tweaked using arrow keys:
.br
.BR Left :
press if video runs ahead of audio
.br
.BR Right :
press if video lags behind audio
.br
.BR Home :
press to reset audio/video offset to 0, so stream timestamps are unchanged.
