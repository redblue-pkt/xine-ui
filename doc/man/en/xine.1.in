.SH NAME
xine \- a free video player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xine
.I "[options] [MRL] ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR xine
audio/video player.
.PP
.B xine
plays MPEG system (audio and video) streams, mpeg elementary streams
(e.g. .mp3 or .mpv files), avi files (using win32 codecs), (S)VCDs
and DVDs.
.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options are included below.
For a complete description, see README and FAQ in @prefix@/share/doc/xine-ui
or on the xine home page.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and available output drivers (plugins).
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-audio\-channel <num>
Select the given audio channel. <num> is the audio channel number, default
is "0".
.br
xine 0.5 and newer tries it's best to collect all valid audio channels
(ac3, mpeg audio, avi audio, ...) from the stream and maps them
to "virtual channels" with channel numbers starting at 0.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-video\-driver <drv>
Select video driver. Check out "xine --help" for a list of available
video output plugins on your system. This selection is stored automatically
in your .xinerc so you'll have to specify the video driver only once.
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-audio\-driver <drv>
Select audio driver. Check out "xine --help" for a list of available
audio output plugins on your system. This selection is stored automatically
in your .xinerc so you'll have to specify the audio driver only once.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-spu\-channel <num>
Select subpicture (subtitle) channel. <num> is the subpicture channel
id, default is no subtitle (-1).
.TP
.B \-p[q][d][v], \-\-auto\-play=[q][d][v]
Start playing immediately after start. Can be followed by "q" for quitting 
at the end. As in earlier versions of xine, it is also possible to request
the playlist from DVD 'd', or VCD 'v'. There is now a more generic option,
\-\-auto\-scan, for that (see below). So the "d" and "v" suboptions may be
removed some day.
.TP
.B \-s <plugin>, \-\-auto\-scan <plugin>
Auto-scan playlist from named input plugin. Many plugins allow to read a
default playlist, in order to play "everything". This works fine for DVDs
or VCDs, for example. Giving this option has the same effect as pressing
the according button on xine's main panel.

This option is especially useful in combination with auto-play. You could
start "xine --auto-play --auto-scan dvd" in order to play a whole DVD without
having to press any additional buttons. This also works for plugins that are
not supplied with xine, just give the name of the button that the desired
plugin adds to the xine panel!
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
Switch xine to fullscreen mode on start (just like pressing "F")
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-hide\-gui
Hide all GUI windows (except the video window) on start. This is the same as
pressing "G" within xine.
.TP
.B \-R, \-\-recognize\-by <option>
Change the way xine will try to recognize stream types. 
Valid options are: 
.br
"default" (first by content, then by extension),
.br
"revert" (first by extension, then by content),
.br
"content" (only by content),
.br
"extension" (only by extension). If no option is given, 
"revert" is selected
.TP
.B \-\-visual <visual-class-or-id>
Try to use a specific X11 server visual for xine windows.  The
<visual-class-or-id> parameter is either the name of an X11 visual
class (StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor or
DirectColor) or the hexadecimal value for a specific X11 visual.

When used with a visual class name, xine tries to find such a visual
with depth 15 or 16, 24 or 32, 8 (in that order).  The default visual
class used by xine in absence of a --visual option is TrueColor.

If no usable visual is found, xine falls back to
the default visual used on the X11 server's root window.
.TP
.B \-\-install
When using an X11 visual with changable colors (colormaps), install a
private colormap for xine.  With a private colormap, xine can allocate
more colors so that video output may look better.
.TP
.B MRL (media resource locator)
.br
MRLs are similar to URLs in your web browser. They describe the media
to read from. valid MRLs may be plain file names or one of the following:
.BR file://<path>
.br
.BR fifo://<path>
.br
.BR stdin://mpeg1
or
.BR "stdin://mpeg2"
.br
.BR "dvd://VTS_xx_y.VOB"
.br
.BR "vcd://<track number>"
.br
.BR "tcp://<host>:<port>"
.br
.BR "rtp://<host>:<port>"
.br
.BR "udp://<host>:<port>"
.LP
Several MRLs may be specified in order to play a number of consecutive
streams.
.LP
If you don't specify any MRL, you'll have to select  a file by drag'n-drop.
Dragging files from the GNOME Midnight Commander (gmc) is known to work.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The programs are documented fully on the xine home page:

.SH CONTROL KEYS
Many features can be controlled by pressing control keys. '\fBM\-\fP' is the Meta key ('Alt' key on PC keyboard), '\fBC\-\fP' is the Control 'CTRL' key, other special key are delimited by '\fB<\fP' and '\fB>\fP' characters, eg: the HOME key is displayed \fB<home>\fP.

.SH Synchronization fine tuning
Some streams have bad timestamps, so synchronization fails. This can be
tweaked using arrow keys:
.br
.BR n | N :
press if video runs ahead of audio
.br
.BR m | M:
press if video lags behind audio
.br
.BR <home> :
press to reset audio/video offset to 0, so stream timestamps are unchanged.
