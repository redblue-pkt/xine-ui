* WHAT IS THIS PLUGIN ABOUT and WHY SHOULD I EVEN CONSIDER TO USE IT? :)
  
  This XINE video output plugin uses the so called Teletux  driver which
  provides special hardware features of the Matrox G400 and  G200  cards
  like deinterlacing, scaling and YUV data to RGB conversion --- just to
  name a few.  The plugin makes all those features available to XINE and
  because all this tasks are done by the graphics card there  is no need
  for XINE to do them in software -- so you save precious CPU time which
  you may gonna need for other things. :-)
  
  Another feature of this plugin is the  synchronisation  of  the  video
  picture with the refresh of your screen.  Before you ask why you would
  need that - here the explanation... :)
  
  In order to have an optimal DVD playback the update of the image needs
  to be syncronized with the vertical refresh of the screen.   Otherwise
  you will sometimes see part of frame n and part of  frame  n+1  during
  playback of a movie. Resulting in tearing artefacts on moving objects.
  
  When using this plugin the update of the screen  is  done  during  the
  vertical retrace of your monitor and  those tearing artefacts are gone
  forever.

  And last but not least, you can finally  use  hardware  deinterlacing,
  so your CPU can lean back and let the graphic card do the work. :)
  

* AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
  
  The Teletux driver is a kernel module you will have to load that makes
  a special device (e.g. /dev/syncfb) available which  is  opened by the
  plugin and controlled with certain ioctl calls. Easy, isn't it? ;-)

  That module is based on the mga_vid driver from Aaron Holzmann and was
  advanced (and reworked) by Matthias Oelmann.


* OK I HEARD ENOUGH - HOW DO I INSTALL and USE IT? :)

  First of all you will need to get the Teletux driver itself.      It's
  available at http://teletux.sourceforge.net.  (please note, that we do
  recommend a recent CVS checkout) Once you downloaded it, unpack  it to
  a directory of your choice, please read the README and  compile  it (a
  normal "make" should work out-of-the-box). Now there are  only  a  few
  things left for you to do...
  
  1) Become root. Hey now you can take over the world *evil laugh* :-)))
  2) Create a device called /dev/syncfb  ===>  mknod /dev/syncfb c 178 0
  3) Copy the file "syncfb.o" to your modules directory (usually this is
     /lib/modules/YOUR_KERNEL_VERSION/) and do a "depmod -a".
  
  This should be it. In order to use the Teletux driver you will have to
  load it with the command "insmod syncfb.o" - please note that you will
  have to load it every time you reboot if you wanna use the driver.

  Now just start XINE once with the following parameter: "-V SyncFB" and
  the SyncFB video out plugin will be used as default plugin.

  It  is  possible now  that the image during video playback is jerking.
  This could be caused by the syncronisiation of the  video  image  with
  your screen refresh. You can easily fix that by switching your monitor
  to the appropriate refresh rates (50 Hz for PAL, 60 Hz for NTSC).  You
  will need to add so called modelines to your XFree86  config  to  make
  those 50 Hz/60 Hz modes available.
  
  Here is is a short listing of some sample modelines. Please  add  only
  those two lines (for NTSC and PAL) which exactly  fit  the  screensize
  you are running your X Server with. You need to add those lines to the
  monitor section of your XF86Config file as well as include their names
  in the screen section  (subsection display of the color depth your are
  using).
 
  USE THE FOLLOWING MODELINES AT YOUR OWN RISK.   THEY COULD DAMAGE YOUR
  MONITOR PERMANTELY - PLEASE TAKE CAUTION AND DON'T BLAME US.  YOU HAVE
  BEEN WARNED.

  So much for the standard disclaimer. :)

  Note: If you want to be on the  safe  side,  generate  your  very  own
        modelines with an application like kvideogen or  use  a  service
	like http://zaph.com/Modeline/ on the web.
	
	Also the modelines may need some fine tuning for your setup. You
	can use xvidtune (comes with XFree86) to do that.

    Modeline "1024x768ntsc" 54.32 1024 1040 1216 1328 768 768 774 802

  # 1280x1024
    
    none yet - might be added in the future

  So before you run  XINE  just turn to the appropriate refresh rate and
  the jerking *should* be gone. (you may also want to have a look at the
  XF86VidMode support included in XINE which makes on-the-fly resolution
  switching possible when fullscreen is toggled)


* WHAT SCREENSIZE SHOULD I PREFER?
  
  Well. It is important that the screensize  you choose for DVD playback
  is exactly the same screensize  you're starting up your X Server  with
  if you are not using the XF86VidMode extension which will properly  do
  the switching for you  and  take  care  that  the  plugin  is  updated
  accordingly. So you shouldn't switch down to 1024x768 yourself if  you
  are running 1280x1024 because that  gives  you  a  virtual  screensize
  of 1280x1024 in a resolution of 1024x768 - and the plugin can't handle
  that - and probably never will.

  You may want to have a look at the XF86VidMode support in  XINE  which
  will enable on-the-fly resolution switching when activating fullscreen.

  Now back to the question. A screensize of 1024x768 should be it. A DVD
  is always 720x576 for pal and 720x480 for ntsc. If you've an anamorphe
  DVD the image only has to be horizontally scaled to get  back  to  the
  original geometry of 16:9 which is easier to be done.


* WHAT ABOUT DEINTERLACING?!

  Pressing 'i' during playback will toggle hardware deinterlacing.     A
  decrease in picture quality is a known side effect,  yet you won't see
  any artefacts caused by interlacing anymore. :-)
  
  One more note, hardware deinterlacing uses BOB as deinterlacing method
  and is totally independent from the software deinterlacing in XINE. So
  specifing a different deinterlacing method in your .xinerc won't  have
  any effect on this feature.


* HEY! THE OVERLAY TURNS OFF WHEN THE WINDOW IS PARTLY OFF THE DESKTOP!?
  
  That's done on purpose.  It  prevents  possible  yet  harmless  screen
  corruption. And by the way - why would you want to see  a  movie  just
  partly?! ;-)


* MY DESKTOP BACKGROUND IMAGE GETS CORRUPTED WHEN USING THIS PLUGIN!

  Even though it doesn't look nice, it's nevertheless harmless.    So no
  need to worry about it. XFree86 is using your  free  video  memory  as
  cache for certain things. Now when you use this plugin  that  part  of
  your video memory could also be used by the syncfb module.     So your
  image data cached there will be corrupted.   Unfortunately there is no
  way to avoid it. Yet, like stated earlier, it is truely  harmless  and
  just a cosmetical side effect.

  
* KNOWN BUGs

  + stopping playback doesn't turn off the syncfb overlay
    
    Currently there is no way to check if playback has stopped from  the
    plugin's point of view - at least none I'm aware of yet.  Working on
    it... (yeah that's what everyone says *grin*)

  + those you may report will be known soon too. :-)


* WHAT IS ON THE TODO LIST?

  + check if the video source is not too big in terms of  dimensions for
    the video memory left (video memory - X reserved video memory)
  + zooming support (currently only implemented with the Xv video out)
  + patching the syncfb kernel module itself for devfs and the  recently
    introduced license tag support
  + updating the documentation
  
  + bug fixes
  + more sanity checks
  + new features
  + optimizations
