building xine on IRIX
---------------------

* Compile xine with GNU make (gmake).


Known Problems
--------------

* No sound

  IRIX does not seem to support OSS audio. The IRIX libaudio driver is not
  yet finished.

* Cannot compile with IRIX cc

  This is an unresolved issue with automake and dependencies.

* xine crashes upon startup

  Some graphics cards (e.g. V8) seem to have problems with xine-ui.
  This is being worked on.
