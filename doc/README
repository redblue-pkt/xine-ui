     a free video player


scope of this document:
-----------------------

this is the end-user documentation for xine-lib and xine-ui. You'll
find more documentation in the doc/ directory of both packages.


about xine:
-----------

xine is a free gpl-licensed video player for unix-like systems. It
supports mpeg-2 and mpeg-1 system (audio + video multiplexed) streams,
mpeg elementary streams (audio/video only, e.g. mp3 files), AVI files
with various video formats (some of them by using win32 dlls). There
is some support for quicktime streams (but most quicktime video and
audio codecs are highly proprietary and thus not supported).

xine plays the video and audio data of the stream and synchronizes
the playback of both. Depending on the properties of the stream,
playback will need more or less processor power, full frame rate
for mpeg-2 has been seen on a 400 MHz P II system.

xine can play Video CDs, SVCDs and DVDs directly. Unfortunately the
legal status of encrypted/locked DVD playback is uncertain in some
countries so xine does not include any DVD unlock/decrypt code. To
play back such DVDs you'll need external programs or something like a
xine_dvd_plugin that can handle DVD authentification/descrambling.
The xine project team denies all responsibility for such uses of xine.

As of xine 0.5 xine's architecture allows for flexible plugins, so
various other stream types and output devices might be supported in
the future.


supported platforms / requirements:
-----------------------------------

- xine needs a X11 server for video output
  (8, 15, 16, 24 or 32 bit color depth)
- xine can detect and use the MIT X video and X shared memory extension
  for better playback performance
- if you can't get Xv to run on your platform you should use 16bpp 
  colordepth for speed. Xv seems to work nicely for any color-depth.
- if you have a mga 200 / 400 graphics adaptor you can optionally
  use the sybcfb/teletux video ouput driver. See README.syncfb for 
  details.
- for audio playback OSS, ALSA, ESD and ARTSD are supported.
- aaxine uses aalib for output and can run on nearly any terminal
- to build xine fairly recent GNU make, gcc and binutils are required


xine should run on any more recent i386-compatible machine (pentium
and higher) using GNU/linux or FreeBSD. Depending on the type of video
stream you want to play you will need more or less cpu-power for fluid
playback. As a rule of thumb, DVDs will typically begin to run nicely
on a Pentium II 400 system (or equivalent). There are many factors in
this equation, so your mileage may vary.

Successfully tested graphic cards (using Xv) for PCs include:
nVidia Riva TNT (closed-sources nvidia drivers), nVidia Riva TNT 2,
Matrox G400, ATI AIW Rage128-16MB, 3dfx voodoo3 2000 PCI 16Mb

The following cards have been reported to work, but it's unclear
whether they work with Xv or only with XShm (please report on
xine-user mailing list):
Trident 9660, ATI AIW M64-8Mb PCI, ATI RageII 8MB.

xine should be able to show video on any type of working xserver with
any graphics card, but with much worse performance than with Xv.

Additionally, xine runs on i386-solaris, sparc machines running linux
or solaris (Creator-3D framebuffer is known to work), see README.solaris
for more information. Also supported: some powerpc based systems
(running linux) and IRIX on MIPS.


usage:
------

You can start xine without any command line parameters or you can
specify one or more input streams directly. xine tries to detect
whether it can use the Xv extension and will fall back to XShm, but
that detection might fail. You can specify the video output plugin by
using the "-V" option, e.g.

xine -V XShm

will force xine to use XShm or plain X11. 

If you want to send the sound over a network with ESD, set the ESPEAKER
environment variable before starting xine.

The input stream can be a filename or something we call
"MediaResourceLocator" (or MRL), which looks similar to a URL. First
you specify an input source which is followed by "://" and an
input-source specific identifier. What input sources you can use
depends on the input plugins you have (for plain files you can omit
the input-source identifier).

Try

$ xine --help

to get more complete information about usage.

xine supports the xdnd protocol (Version 3) so if you have a file browser 
application supporting that protocol (e.g. gmc) you can drop video files
on xine for playback.

Playing track 3 from a VCD:

$ xine vcd://3

Example for direct DVD access:

$ xine dvd://VTS_01_1.VOB

more to come.

Rightclick (or press 'G') on the video window to toggle panel visibility.


selecting audio channels:
-------------------------

Supply the -a option to select the desired audio track:

xine -a 3 test.mpg

plays the third available audio track (and the video, of course).

Alternatively the gui can be used to select an audio channel.


selecting subtitles:
--------------------

Subtitles are embedded in different tracks like audio. In general,
track 0 is the default language subtitle. Use the -u option to 
select the desired subtitle track:

xine -u 0 test.vob

displays the subtitles from stream 0.

Alternatively the gui can be used to select a subtitle channel.


using LIRC with xine:
---------------------

xine can be remotly controlled with by IR. For this, you should have
LIRC installed (http://www.lirc.org). You should get latest CVS snapshot
if you're running recent Linux kernels (2.2 or 2.4 series). 

You should add some entries in your ~/.lircrc, like this:
begin
	remote = SAMSUNG
	button = Button_Play
	prog   = xine
	repeat = 0
	config = PLAY
end
begin
	remote = SAMSUNG
	button = Button_Src
	prog   = xine
	repeat = 0
	config = DVD
end
begin
	remote = SAMSUNG
	button = Button_1
	prog   = xine
	repeat = 0
	config = 10%
end
...


Valid commands for lirc are (case insensitive):

 - to quit:
      quit
 - to set the current position in current stream playback:
      0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% 
 - to play or stop:
      play
 - for pausing:
      pause
 - for eject:
      eject
 - for next/previous MRL in the playlist:
      next, prev
 - for next/previous audio track selection:
      audio+, audio-
 - for next/previous sub-title selection:
      spu+, spu-
 - to get the playlist from a DVD/VCD:
      dvd, vcd
 - to hide/show the GUI, the output video window:
      hidegui, hideoutput
 - to toggle the output video window<->fullscreen
      fullscr


freedom, DVDs and stuff:
------------------------

xine is free software. "free software" is somewhat related to being
"open-source". however, the meaning of "free software" goes further
than just that: it is about the freedom of users of software. if you
have the time, please read what the free software foundation says
about the topics of freedom and software:
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

there is a very special threat to freedom when it comes to DVDs: the
movie industry is making huge efforts to restrict playback of DVDs to
controlled devices. Most DVDs that are currently sold are encrypted in
a proprietary way - and in some countries (most notably the usa), it
is possibly illegal to decrypt them - even for private viewing.
hopefully most people will agree that this is a very questionable way
to treat customers. the xine project team condemns these efforts of
the movie industry - trying to prevent loss of sales in such a way
surely shows a lot of disrespect towards all their honest customers.
on the other hand, the xine project team is against breaking existing
law. noone knows exactly if it is actually illegal anywhere in the
world to write, own and use software for viewing encrypted DVDs. but
as this is an unclear topic (that seems potentially very dangerous),
xine does not contain any specific code for decrypting DVDs. it seems,
however, that third parties are working on such extensions. possibly
in some places it is legal to use these.  whichever way - you will not
be able to play encrypted DVDs with xine out-of-the-box. please note
that this is not a bug or 'missing feature', but a genuine legal
problem. it would be great to solve the problem (i.e. convincing
america and/or the movie industry that they are really annoying and
unnecessarily unfair to customers as well as users and developers of
free software), but including code to decrypt DVDs in xine won't solve
this problem.


used software:
--------------

xine uses code from the following external free software projects:

- liba52 by Aaron Holtzman and Michel Lespinasse
- libmpeg2 by Aaron Holtzman and Michel Lespinasse
- libmad by Robert Leslie
- libmpg123 of the mpg123 project by Michael Hipp
- libffmpeg by Gerard Lantau

...without these great pieces of software xine would of course not be
where it is now.

also many thanks to the Linux Video and DVD Project "LiViD"
(http://www.linuxvideo.org/), where the original ideas for the xine
video player came from.
