xine is a free, GPL licensed media player designed to play everything you want.
(We might not have reached that goal yet, but we are pretty close.)

This is the end-user documentation for xine. You can find more documentation in
the documentation directories of the xine-lib and xine-ui packages, usually
these will be installed in /usr/share/doc/ or /usr/share/doc/packages, or, if
you compiled xine yourself in /usr/local/share/doc/ or
/usr/local/share/doc/packages.

Further information like a feature list, the software of other projects we use
and the developer's wishlists in case you want to support xine by donation can
be found on the xine website at http://www.xine-project.org/.

If you experience any problems with xine, be sure to first have a look at the
FAQ, which should come together with xine-lib. Additionally, the latest version
can always be found on the website http://www.xine-project.org/faq.

There is also a developer's document available, called the xine hacker's guide.
If you are going to help in extending xine or simply want to know, how xine
works inside, have a look at this. You should find it installed on your system
in HTML form, but you can also browse the latest version at
http://www.xine-project.org/hackersguide.

If all else fails and you still have questions, consult the xine-user mailing
list at sourceforge for usage problems or the xine-devel list for questions on
xine development.

Have fun with xine.
