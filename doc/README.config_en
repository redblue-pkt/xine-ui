                                ------------------
                                xine configuration
                                ------------------

These settings may be found on ~/.xine/config.

Since xine 0.9.6 they may also be changed using the xine setup dialog.

Some settings on setup dialog will require xine to be restarted to take effect.

                                              synchronization, even if the

                                              to support real-time
                        2 = FORCE_GETOPTR:    Try to force use of the
                                              SNDCTL_DSP_GETOPTR ioctl
                                              to achieve true audio/video
                                              synchronization, even if the

                                              the video, even if the audio
                                              driver actually has support for
                                              real-time - there may be audio/
                                              video synchronization issues
                                              with use of this setting

audio.oss_latency               For softsync you can manually adjust the default
				a/v sync latency here. The units are in miliseconds,

video driver specific values:
-----------------------------

video.deinterlace_method	method to use for software-deinterlacing (currently
				only supported on Xv driver):
			0 none
			1 bob: if movement is detected on interlaced lines
			  interpolate the pixels. lose resolution only on
			  moving pixels but should avoid zig-zag effects.
			2 weave: similar to bob with a tendency to preserve
			  original image (less interpolation). must be
			  good for high detail on low-movement scenes,
			  but usually has bad output.
			3 greedy: take either the older or newer weave pixel
			  depending upon which give the smaller comb factor,
			  and then clip to avoid large damage when wrong.
			  very good results for low or intermediate motion.
			4 onefield: always interpolate lines, not matter they
			  are static or moving. always lose resolution.
			5 onefieldxv: the same as onefield except we deliver
			  half of the lines to Xvideo driver and let it scale
			  for us. very low cpu usage. not all cards implement
			  bilinear scaling (interpolation) so this may be
			  the worst quality method, but it's the only that
			  don't require MMX.


video.syncfb_device             Path to the syncfb device (default: /dev/syncfb)
			
video.syncfb_default_repeat     Specifies how many times a frame is repeated.

video.XV_DOUBLE_BUFFER          Enable double buffering to sync video on
                                monitor retrace. At least nvidia drivers
                                should support this.
