                                xine configuration
                                ------------------

These settings may be found on ~/.xine/config.

Since xine 0.9.6 they may also be changed using the xine setup dialog.

Some settings on setup dialog will require xine to be restarted to take effect.

                                do support.  The default value of 0 attempts to

                                     preference order being GETODELAY,
                                     GETOPTR, and finally SOFTSYNC

                                     SNDCTL_DSP_GETODELAY ioctl
                                     to achieve true audio/video
                                     synchronization, even if the
                                     audio driver doesn't claim
                                     to support real-time
                        getoptr:     Try to force use of the

                                     synchronization, even if the
                                     system supports the preferred
                                     SNDCTL_DSP_GETODELAY ioctl
                        softsync:    Force use of the system real-time

                                     the video, even if the audio
                                     driver actually has support for
                                     real-time - there may be audio/
                                     video synchronization issues
                                     with use of this setting
                        probebuffer: Probe sound card buffer size on
                                     initialization to calculate the
                                     audio latency for a/v sync.
                                     Try this if your system doesn't
                                     support the real-time ioctl's
                                     and you experienced sync errors
                                     after long playbacks.
                         

audio.oss_device_num            -1, 0-16: Forces the OSS plugin to use the specified
                                dspX device, regardless of its capabilities.
                                If -1 (default) is specified, the audio device with
                                the best capabilities will be used.
                                Note: /dev/dsp is usually a symlink to /dev/dsp0
           
audio.oss_latency               For softsync you can manually adjust the default
                                a/v sync latency here. The units are in miliseconds,
                                so if the sound seems delayed 1 second from the video
                                set it to 1000. (default value = 0)

video driver specific values:
-----------------------------

video.deinterlace_method    method to use for software-deinterlacing (currently
                            only supported on Xv driver):
                     0 none
                     1 bob: if movement is detected on interlaced lines
                       interpolate the pixels. lose resolution only on
                       moving pixels but should avoid zig-zag effects.
                     2 weave: similar to bob with a tendency to preserve
                       original image (less interpolation). must be
                       good for high detail on low-movement scenes,
                       but usually has bad output.
                     3 greedy: take either the older or newer weave pixel
                       depending upon which give the smaller comb factor,
                       and then clip to avoid large damage when wrong.
                       very good results for low or intermediate motion.
                     4 onefield: always interpolate lines, not matter they
                       are static or moving. always lose resolution.
                     5 onefieldxv: the same as onefield except we deliver
                       half of the lines to Xvideo driver and let it scale
                       for us. very low cpu usage. not all cards implement
                       bilinear scaling (interpolation) so this may be
                       the worst quality method, but it's the only that
                       don't require MMX.
                     6 linearblend: does a kind of vertical blurring over
                       the image to remove interlace artifacts. simple but
                       reported to produce good results.


video.syncfb_device             Path to the syncfb device (default: /dev/syncfb)
                     
video.syncfb_default_repeat     Specifies how many times a frame is repeated.
                                Defaults to 3.
                                (note: hardware deinterlacing will always use 1)

video.driver                    video driver to use, same as command line 
                                option -V
                                (e.g. aa, Syncfb, XShm, Xv)

video.xshm_gamma                gamma correction for XShm driver (-100..100)
                                note: in fact, it may be referred as brightness

video.disable_scaling           some drivers (like XShm) do image scaling by
                                software. disabling it will greatly improve 
                                playback performance, but the video will never
                                be scaled to fit window size.

*** NOTE: not all XV attributes are available for every video card/driver
      
video.XV_COLORKEY               -1000..1000: X11 XVideo COLORKEY property value.
                                colorkey to use, may be usefull to change
                                if parts of your desktop become transparent

video.XV_BRIGHTNESS             -1000..1000: X11 XVideo BRIGHTNESS property value.

video.XV_HUE                    -1000..1000: X11 XVideo HUE property value.

video.XV_FILTER                 Enable bilinear scaling mode on Permedia cards
                                (may impact on performance)
                                            0 = no filter
                                Permedia 2: 1 = enabled
                                Permedia 3: 1 = partial (x direction); 2 = full
                                No other cards seem to support this. 

video.XV_DOUBLE_BUFFER          Enable double buffering to sync video on
                                monitor retrace. At least nvidia drivers
                                should support this.

                             mode by using the XF86VidMode Extension.
                             (0) off [default]

gui.stream_resize_window    this setting control xine-ui resizing behaviour.
                            there are two possible policies:
                            (0) off: never resize window to match stream size.
                                user should manually change the video window
                                to the desired size. all streams will be fitted
                                inside the window.
                            (1) on: always resize window when stream size changes.
                                user may still manually resize a playing video
                                but if the stream size changes (eg. next MRL,
                                dvd menus, etc) the window will be automatically
                                resized.

                            dvdnav), play next|previous button will skip
