	 Here is a small summary of xitk hidden features ;-)
         ---------------------------------------------------

    - xitk can be slightly tuned for user requirements (read: you can
made small changes). You can change default colors, fonts, and timers.

			       RC file
			       -------
User can add a '.xitkrc' in their home directory, and system admins can add 
a 'xitkrc' file in /etc (system wide rc file). 
If the user have his own .xitkrc file, the system wide rc file is simply ignored.

NOTE: colors can be: pixel color value, tripled value or named colors (see widget.c)

Each entries are optional.
