Description: the xine video player, user interface 
 This is an X11 based GUI for the libxine video player library. It provides
 a skin based media player that can play all the audio/video formats that
 libxine supports. Currently, this includes MPEG1/2, some AVI files and
 disc based media (VCD, SVCD, DVD).
 .
 This package contains an additional frontend, aaxine, which uses aalib to
 render ASCII art video. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it
 to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-)
 .
 Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
 System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descrample those DVDs,
 because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at
 /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information!
