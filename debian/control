Description: the xine video player, user interface 
 This is an X11 based GUI for the libxine video player library.
 It provides xine, a skin based media player that can play all the
 audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this includes MPEG1/2,
 some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based
 media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found on
 http://xine.sf.net/.
 .
 This package contains an additional frontend, aaxine, which runs even on the
 console. aaxine uses aalib to render ASCII art video, or you can tell it to
 use a framefuffer device. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it
 to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-)
 .
 Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
 System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs,
 because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at
 /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information!
