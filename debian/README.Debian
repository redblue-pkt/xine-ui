xine-ui for Debian
------------------

This package (along with libxine) is the official successor of the xine
media player.
Along with the new architecture (with separate libxine), some packaging
issues appeared: xine-lib, ie libxine is _not_ compiled with the -fPIC option.
This is a clear policy violation, but there's a good reason for this:
First of all, the whole point of -fPIC is allowing several instances of the
library in memory at the same time, saving memory and gaining performance via
saved cache space. But it's very unlikely that someone will watch several
movies on the same machine at the same time...
On the other hand, compiling the library with -fPIC takes an additional
register which results in some 5% performance loss. So with -fPIC, you'd need
at least a PIII-600 in order to playback DVDs. Without that, a PII-450 is
sufficient... (provided that an Xv capable video adapter is available)

Another minor issue is the lack of a static libxine. This is currently not
really supported, but I'll try my best to add it to libxine-dev if someone
needs it. Just contact me at <xine@packages.debian.org> in that case!


the CSS issue
=============

Due to possible legal issues, xine doesn't include any code to descramble CSS
"enhanced" DVDs. CSS is sold by the DVD industry as a "copy protection", though
it's more of a "view protection" as it makes DVDs unviewable with unlicensed
players (like xine).
Some people have hacked CSS decryption routines, and some of those are
available as xine plugins. So if you have such a DVD, have a look at one of
the CSS plugin sites! If you are positive that it's allowed where you live,
you can just install the Plugin and watch all your DVDs...
