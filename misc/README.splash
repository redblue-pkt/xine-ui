Splash & logo files reside in "misc/splash-$NAME". Certain files in that
directory are distributed automatically, and two of these are installed
(chosen at configure time). First match is preferred.

	xine-ui_logo.jpg
	xine-ui_logo.mpv
	xine-ui_logo.png

	xine_splash.jpg
	xine_splash.png

If extra source files need to be distributed, name them in
"misc/splash-$NAME/manifest". Names are whitespace-separated; one per line
is preferred.

$NAME is read from misc/splash.
