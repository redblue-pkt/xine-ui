xine-ui (0.9.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * started the xine-ui ChangeLog again
  * lots of bugfixes
  * new, cool, default theme
  * removed all the other themes from default distribution
    (you can still down load them from http://xine.sf.net)
  * xine-ui now reports unsupported codec formats
  * probably more things that I don't recall
