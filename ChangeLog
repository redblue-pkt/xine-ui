  * improved TV mode selection (untested)
  * localization updates (including correct numeric plural forms)
  * aaxine should work with linux or slang drivers again
  * improved performance on IA-32 (compiling without -funroll-all-loops)
  * setup dialog features brand-new xitk scrollbars
  * prev/next buttons optionally switch chapters (instead of MRLs) on supported media
  * invalid buttons (eg. "play" without an MRL) are disabled
  
  And, of course, lots of other small bugfixes and improvements...
